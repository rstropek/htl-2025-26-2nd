## Introduction

This is a repository for students learning about TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Repository Structure

- `/startercode` - Contains the initial codebase for students to start their projects. Includes TypeScript and Vite.
- `/homeworks` - Contains homework assignments and exercises for students to complete. Partly contains sample solutions.
- Topic folders like `/10-dom` to learn about DOM manipulation, `/12-svg` for SVG graphics, etc.

## Coding Guidelines

* As this repository is for beginners, keep TypeScript rather simple. Avoid advanced features like generics, decorators, or complex type manipulations. Focus on fundamental concepts and practical applications.
* Always use TypeScript, do not use plain JavaScript.
* Never use `any` as a type.
* Prefer `type` over `interface` unless you need to use `extends`.
* Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
