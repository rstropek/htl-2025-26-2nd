# Lightning Talk Topics

In this document, you can find a list of possible topics for your lightning talk. You can choose any topic from the list or propose your own topic (make sure to get it approved by me first).

## AI Coding Tools

Introduce an AI coding tool to your classmates. Give a high-level overview of its features and include a live demo. In case of very large and powerful tools, focus on a specific feature that you find particularly useful. It is perfectly ok if you limit the presentation of features that are available for free or during a time-limited trial.
